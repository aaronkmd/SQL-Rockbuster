# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis

This repository contains the SQL queries and a data dictionary used to analyze the business operations of Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a fictional movie rental company transitioning to an online video rental service. This project forms part of a data analytics course designed to simulate real-world business scenarios.

## Project Overview

As part of a coursework assignment, I was tasked with guiding the digital transition strategy for Rockbuster Stealth using SQL. This involved loading all of Rockbuster’s mock operational data into a PostgreSQL database and employing SQL to extract the data necessary for informed decision-making.

## Key Questions Addressed

1. Identifying the most and least profitable films.
2. Determining average rental duration for all film titles.
3. Understanding the geographical distribution and lifetime value of Rockbuster customers.
4. Analyzing revenue variation across different countries and regions.

## Repository Contents

- **SQL Queries:** Custom scripts written to analyze the simulated data, addressing specific business questions to support strategic decisions for the hypothetical online service launch.
- **Data Dictionary:** Documentation of the database schema, providing a detailed description of the data structures and relationships used in the analysis.
